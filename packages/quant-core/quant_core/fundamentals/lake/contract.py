"""Platform contract layer — map a ``TickerIdentity`` to the byte-compatible ``line_items`` dict the
PIT fundamentals seam serves.

This is the single place that turns the lake's standardized PIT series (``store`` + ``metrics``) into
the exact snake_case ``line_items`` dict ``quant_core.fundamentals.contract.LINE_ITEMS`` pins — the
shape strategy-engine (`fundamentals_as_of.py`) and market-data-service (`PitFundamentalsProvider.ts`)
parse byte-for-byte. The read-API (Task 10) wraps this: it builds a ``TickerIdentity`` from each
request ticker, calls :func:`pit_line_items`, runs the Gap-2 enrichment (``market_cap_gbp`` +
``dividend_yield``), and serves ``{ticker: {<14 line_items>, source, observation_ts, knowledge_ts}}``.

THE THREE PIVOTS (the only fundamentals logic here):
  * **Flows → TTM-or-annual.** ``net_income`` / ``total_revenue`` / ``gross_profit`` / ``cash_flow_ops``
    prefer the latest trailing-twelve-month point (four consecutive quarters as-of), falling back to
    the latest annual when no TTM is derivable, else omitted. More current than a stale annual without
    losing PIT-safety (a derived TTM never surfaces before all four inputs were public — the
    ``filed = max(inputs)`` carry, enforced in ``metrics``).
  * **Instants → latest period_end ≤ as_of.** ``total_equity`` / ``total_assets`` /
    ``total_liabilities`` / ``current_assets`` / ``current_liabilities`` / ``total_debt`` /
    ``shares_outstanding`` take the last point of the instant series (the store already PIT-filters,
    so the last ``end`` is the most recent balance-sheet instant knowable at the cutoff).
  * **``earnings_stability`` (NEW leg).** Not produced by the old PIT path (Yahoo-only there), so no
    byte-compat constraint — computed here from the as-of ANNUAL ``net_income`` series as the inverse
    coefficient of variation (see :func:`earnings_stability`). Higher = steadier earnings, matching the
    ``QualityFactor`` contract sign.

FAIL-CLOSED, EVERYWHERE:
  * Non-US (``market != 'US'``) → ``({}, None, None, None)`` immediately. LSE/foreign names have no
    EDGAR presence and — per Thread C — there is NO Yahoo fallback; those legs are NaN-excluded
    downstream. The store would itself return None for a non-US ``resolve``, but short-circuiting here
    avoids the (pointless) resolve call.
  * An unresolved CIK (cold lake / unknown / private name) → ``({}, None, None, None)``.
  * A leg whose value is ``None`` is DROPPED from the dict — never coerced to ``0`` (a fabricated 0
    would corrupt a ratio; the factor NaN-excludes a missing key instead). This is the
    ``{k: v for k, v in … if v is not None}`` guard.

``market_cap_gbp`` and ``dividend_yield`` are deliberately NOT computed here — the read-API's Gap-2
enrichment (``market_cap.py`` + ``apply_dividend_yield``, Task 10) adds them from the as-of adjusted
close × shares × FX, off the ``shares_outstanding`` this layer supplies. Keys are the EXACT
``LINE_ITEMS`` spellings (imported, never re-listed, so the producer and the consumer cannot drift).

pyarrow + duckdb are only reached transitively through ``store`` (the ``quant-core[lake]`` extra); this
module itself is pure stdlib + the two lake submodules.

    larger population; it is also defined for the N = 3 floor (a sample stddev with ddof = 1 over 3

    QualityFactor sign); only the magnitude of the stddev governs the dispersion penalty.

    SIC template through, same as every other leg) — ``None``/``"general"`` ⇒ the default concept list.
